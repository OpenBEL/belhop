## Getting Started

**Start** with the [belhop namespace](belhop.html) to get an idea of what
the library can do.

**Read** the growing suite of
[behavioral tests](https://github.com/OpenBEL/belhop/tree/next/spec)
to see how to interact with the library in JavaScript.

**Understand** the [types and globals](global.html) to use it effectively.

## Builds

Builds of the library are tested in Google Chrome before being published.
These builds are available on the
[OpenBEL Build Server](http://build.openbel.org). If you want to work with
stable integration builds of features in development, the
[OpenBEL Discuss Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openbel-discuss) is where to go and get started.
