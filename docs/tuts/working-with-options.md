## Filter Options

Filter options give you the ability to control what is returned to you by
filtering the data that is requested. This can be done by using default filters
options or by specifying custom filters that will be passed directly to the
server.

Each filter option is comprised of *category*, *name*, and *value*.

### Default Filter Options

The default filter performs a full-text search for a specific value.

### Custom Filter Options

The custom filter behaves according to how the server processes the filter.

## Search Options

Search options give you the ability page through the filtered data that is
requested. Like filter options, default search options and custom search
options are available.

Each search option is comprised of *start*, *size*, and *faceted*, as well as
optional *filterOptions*.
